### **About Us**

**Paylora** is a developer-first toolkit for integrating secure, low-cost crypto payments. Our upgradeable smart contracts run on Arbitrum, allowing businesses to accept payments directly to their own wallets without intermediaries. We are building a complete suite of tools, including a core smart contract, a merchant API, and a frontend SDK to make integration fast and simple. Our plan is to secure the protocol via third-party audits and seek grants to accelerate growth and adoption.

### **Our Projects**

* **[paylora-contract](https://github.com/paylora-org/paylora-contract)**: The core upgradeable (UUPS) smart contract for payment processing.
* **[paylora-api](https://github.com/paylora-org/paylora-api)**: The backend service, including the Merchant API and dashboard.
* **[ui-sdk](https://github.com/paylora-org/ui-sdk)**: The frontend UI-SDK for easy integration of the payment button.
